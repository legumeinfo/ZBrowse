NA,"Welcome to ZBrowse. This tour walks you through some highlights of this comparative GWAS viewer."
NA,"We begin in the Manage tab, where you can load GWAS data for different organisms and traits."
#tour-dataset,"First select an organism [dataset], in this case Medicago truncatula."
#tour-loaddata,"Then load one or more GWAS files. In this case, choose a remote traits file like <b>trichomes</b>, then click Load Data."
#tour-columnSettings,"The GWAS table is now populated. Tweak the column headers if necessary."
#tour-dataset2,"Repeat for the second organism, in this case Arabidopsis thaliana."
#tour-loaddata2,"Choose the two remote traits files (<b>Trichome avg C</b> and <b>Trichome avg JA</b>), then click Load Data."
#tour-columnSettings2,"The GWAS table is now populated. You may tweak the column headers, but should not need to do so."
#tour-datatable,"The Data Table tab displays the raw GWAS data you just loaded. You can filter on different column values."
#tour-wholegenome-macrosynteny,"In the Whole Genome View, the Macro-synteny chart for species 2 plots syntenic blocks v. their distance metric from those for species 1 (above). Mouseover a block to view its details."
#tour-macrosynteny,"Macro-synteny parameters:<br>The Genome Context Viewer returns macro-synteny blocks with at least <i>M</i> matching and at most <i>I</i> non-matching gene families, omitting orphans and those that occur more than <i>mask</i> times. The GCV computes the Levenshtein or Jaccard distance metric for each block."
#tour-wholegenome,"The Whole Genome View also displays the Manhattan plots for the two organisms. For Medicago truncatula, click on the trichomes SNP with the highest p-value in chromosome 4 (base pair 33,073,169) to zoom into the Chromosome View, then click Next."
#tour-pChart,"In the whole Chromosome View, you may click on any SNP to recenter the (zoomed) annotation window below. But leave it as is for now."
#tour-zChart,"In the zoomed Chromosome View, you may click on any gene to pop up a list of links to LIS sites (not visible in this tour?)."
#tour-genLink,"The Genomic Linkage Options manage communication with the Genome Context Viewer."
#tour-microsynteny,"Micro-synteny parameters:<br>The GCV returns matching genes within <i>N</i> neighbors of the selected gene, where there are at least <i>M</i> matches and at most <i>I</i> non-matches."
#tour-zChart,"Click on the short gene to the right of 33 Mbp in the reverse (lower) strand (<i>hypothetical protein</i>). Compare the pattern of color-coded gene families to those for Arabidopsis thaliana (below)."
#tour-genLink-2,"In this example, Arabidopsis thaliana has two matching regions on different chromosomes. You may select the other one from the Related Regions menu."
#tour-annotations,"The Annotations Table tab displays the annotations for all genes within the current zoomed Chromosome View. You can filter on different column values."
NA,"Enjoy using ZBrowse!"
